% If an amount of money A is invested for k years at a nominal annual interest rate r (expressed as a decimal fraction),
& the value V of the investment after k years is given by :  V =A(1+r/n)^nk  
%wheren isthenumberofcompoundingperiodsperyear.Write a program to 
compute V as n gets larger and larger â€” that is,as the compounding 
periods be come more and more frequent:monthly,daily,hourly,and so forth.TakeA =1000,r =4%,andk =10 years.You should observe 
that your output gradually approaches a limit. Hint:use a for loop that doubles n each time,starting with n=1. 
A=input('capital=')
k=input('number of years=')
r=input('rata anual=')
n=input('write the fecuency of the period "12" to monthly, "1"anual,"360"daily')
if n==12
    y=1:(12*k);
    V=A*(1+(r./y)).^(y*k)
end
 if n==1
    x=1:(k*n);
    V=A*(1+(r./x)).^(x*k)
 end
 if n==360
     z=1:(k*n);
     V=A*(1+(r./z)).^(z*k)
 end
