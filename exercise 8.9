One of the programs in Section 8.2 shows that anamount of $1000 will double in eight years with an interest rate of 10%.Using the same interest rate,
run the program with initial balances of $500,$2000,and $10,000 (say) to see how long they take to double. The results may surprise you
a=input('Opening balance=\n')
interest_rate=0.1;
y=a
years=0;
disp('balance per year')
while y<2*a
    y=y+(interest_rate*y);
    years=years+1
end
